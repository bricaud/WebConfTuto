    "# Clustering and community detection (unsupervised learning)\n",
    "Many real-world networks posesses communities, groups of nodes that are more connected together than with the rest of the network. Detecting these structures is of high importance. It reveals the hierarchy, the organization and interactions between nodes. It helps classifying parts of a network into categories. It can be seen as an equivalent of the unsupervised learning `k-means` clustering algorithm. Instead of computing distances and grouping data points in a high dimensional space, we use the network structure to detect the clusters.\n",

The edges removed are the ones with the highest number of shortest paths passing through them (\"bottlenecks\" between communities). The idea is clear and intuitive. However, the computation is intensive as all shortest paths have to be computed. Moreover, the number of communities has to be specified as this algorithm do not have a stopping criterium (this can be an advantage or drawback)."
